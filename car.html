        <p><b>The evolution of cars began in the late 18th century with steam-powered vehicles, but the real breakthrough came in 1885 when Karl Benz invented the first gasoline-powered automobile. In the early 1900s, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, making cars affordable for ordinary people and transforming transportation worldwide. Over time, cars became more stylish, powerful, and comfortable, especially during the mid-20th century. From the 1980s onward, technology improved vehicle safety and efficiency with features like airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and fuel injection. In recent years, electric and hybrid cars have become popular as people focus on reducing pollution and protecting the environment. Today, modern cars include smart features such as GPS navigation, touchscreen displays, and even self-driving technology, showing how far automobiles have advanced since their invention</b></p>
